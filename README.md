Design & Structural Decisions
This redesign focuses on improving clarity of communication, modern layout, and modularity. The homepage clearly communicates Ryze AI’s value — automated ads management and optimized campaign performance — using a clean hero banner, feature cards, and social proof through testimonials. The site is built with reusable sections such as Header, Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, and Footer to support future updates. It is fully mobile-responsive, accessible, and designed with consistent typography and a professional color scheme to match modern SaaS branding.


To strengthen the “Clearly communicate what Ryze does” requirement, use actual product messaging like:

Hero: “Let AI manage your paid ads 24/7 — optimize Google & Meta campaigns automatically” 
Ryze AI

Features:

24/7 real-time optimization

AI-generated creatives

Automated budget & keyword management 
Ryze AI

Testimonials: You can use generic versions or real quotes from the actual site if appropriate.
